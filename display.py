"""Graphical display for treemapper.  Displays Tk graphics incrementally
and returns an SVG version, which can be saved to a file.

A color scheme from a key: color table and/or a CSS style sheet
may be applied based on graphics.display_options.

Note we are using modules (display, tk_display, svg_display) as stateful objects,
which makes them "singletons".   To allow multiple instances of display (e.g.,
 building two different treemaps at the same time to compare them) would require
rewrite of all three modules to isolate state in objects managed by other code.

#               value: object = None):
#           Draws a tile.  The tile is labeled with key (string) and/or value (usually numeric).
#           If provided, the key will be normalized to conform to SVG/CSS naming rules and may be mapped to a color
#           in graphics.display_options.color_scheme (usually from a CSV file via color_scheme.py)
#           or associated with CSS styling through graphics.display_options.css.
#           Example normalization of keys to CSS class identifiers:
#               "dogs" -> "dogs",
#               "99 problems & 32 solutions" -> "C_99problems32solutions"
#           A color may be inherited from an enclosing group.  If there is no associated color
#           for the key or any enclosing group, a random color (and contrasting label color)
#           will be generated.

#           Begins a rectangular group of tiles, which should tile r.
#           Arguments are the same as draw_tile, but the label is not displayed in Tk and in
#           SVG is only visible as a tool tip on hover.  To hover on a group, place cursor
#           *between* tiles. begin_group must be paired with matching end_group.
#
#       end_group():
#           Marks the end of the current group of tiles. Groups may be nested arbitrarily, but
#           must be properly nested (like nested parentheses).   Tiles can inherit colors within
#           groups, in both the Tk graphics and the SVG graphics.
#
#       svg_content() -> list[str]:
#           Returns the SVG representation as a list of strings.
#           Typically these should be written to a file, which can then
#           be opened in a web browser or illustration application like
#           Inkscape (free and open source) or Adobe Illustrator (very not free or open source).
